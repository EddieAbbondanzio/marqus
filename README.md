Marqus is a free, markdown note taking app for Linux that allows for infinitely nestable notes to help with organization.

Notes are kept in plain text files and are not proprietary so there's no vendor lock in.

Notes can links to other notes, and directly inline files and images within them.

The editor has multi tab support to make it easier to switch back and forth between multiple note files at once.
