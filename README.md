## Features

- Multi-tab support makes it easy to switch back and forth between notes without losing your place.
- Infinitely nestable notes makes it easy to organize things.
- Customizable shortcuts lets you add custom shortcuts for the things you use most, and disable the ones you don't want.
- App state is persisted so the next time you open the app you can pick up where you last left off.
- Easy to use search that supports searching note names, or content.
- Customizable sorting that can be specified globally, or on a per note basis.
- No bloat UI that lets you focus on what matters most. Your notes.
